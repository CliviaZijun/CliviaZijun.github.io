            The order of website design should be first to determine the page type, then design and build the basic structure of the page, and then refine the layout from big to small, so that we can not only be confident when doing it, but also save a lot of effort for later modification. 
            More importantly, users will also have a better experience. 
            <br><br>
            However, when I was working on this page, I was more of a freewheeling layout designer who lack of an overall design concept, which caused me trouble when I want to change some places at a late stage.
            <br><br>
            If I were asked to do this page again, I think I would follow the following ideas: 
            <br>
            <div class="step">
                <b>√</b>&nbsp; First, determine the type of page. It is because that different types of websites will have different emphasis in layout. 
                <br>
                <b>√</b>&nbsp; Second, analyze needs and plan. What are the needs and goals of this page? What are the needs of website users? What are the plans? Which plan is better? Why? 
                <br>
                <b>√</b>&nbsp; Third, design the overall layout of the page. According to the analysis results, divide the page into several main modules, such as the navigation module, the head module, the main content module, and the foot module. Then, think about how to arrange the location of these modules. 
                <br>
                <b>√</b>&nbsp; Finally, start to do it, gradually refine it from big to small. At the same time, test it, think about it, until finishing the whole page.
