                    <h2>What is Art Toys</h2>
                    <p>
                       Art Toys is usually regarded as a collection of adults over the age of 15 and has collection properties of artwork. <br><br>
                       They are either handmade by designers or made by independent toy companies. <br><br>
                       Because of technical and financial constraints, they are usually sold in limited quantities. <br><br>
                       They are not assembly-line products, but a condensation of the designer's abstract design thinking and ideas.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        1990s - Art Toys first appeared in Japan and China's Hong Kong. <br><br>
                        2000s - China's Taiwan and Hong Kong started holding Art toy exhibitions. <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art toys spreaded to China's mainland, Europe and America. <br><br>
                        2010s - More and more studios and IPs of art toys occured . <br><br>       
                        So far - The influence of Art toys is getting wider and wider.

                    <h2>Materials</h2>
                    <p>
                        Art toys has a wide variety of materials, among which the common materials can be classified into two categories: plastic and resin. <br><br>
                        <b>Plastic:</b> There are five main varieties of common general-purpose plastics: PE, PP, PVC, PS and ABS. <br> Among them, PVC and ABS are often used in Art toys. <br><br>
                        <b>Resin:</b> The resin material of Art Toys are mostly PU resin, which is also a kind of plastic. It has some characteristics that the traditional five general purpose plastics do not have,
                        so people prefer to distinguish it from other plastics. <br><br>
                        Each material has its own advantages, and designers will choose the material according to the shape of the toy.

                    <h2>About This Website</h2>
                    <p>
                        Wikipedia says that the Art Toys are toys and collectibles created by artists and designers. <br><br>
                        But I prefer to call them kidult's toys, because they can bring people that pure joy like opening a new toy in childhood. <br><br>
                        In my country, China, there are many excellent Art Toys, but not that famous enough. <br><br>
                        Therefore, I can't wait to share them and their stories with you. <br><br>
                        Hope you can meet yourself in these Art toys :).

                            <b>Story: </b>Guagua is based on an autistic child. After reaching out to an autistic child named "Guagua" at a charity event, the designer searched through documentaries and books to understand the pain, joy, and superior perception of people with autism. Guagua was created in the process of designer helping and observing "Guagua" and his family. At the same time, "Guagua" also let the designer find himself, the designer said that “Everyone is a lonely individual. People are eager to communicate but believe only what is on the surface, and are becoming less perceptive. From "Guagua", I learned how to communicate with my heart and it inspired my positive energy, which made me motivated to create and willing to pay more.”

                            <b>Story: </b>Is it really unforgivable to go against the grain? Are people in this age qualified to evaluate the moral values of their predecessors? When people's edges and corners are gradually wiped out and their heart are losing courage, they will lose more possibilities of life and eventually be like a frog in a well, thinking that what they see is the whole world. The world is easy to be bound by the secular, but there will still be some noble soul can stand out, even if there will be a crushing defeat, even if they will bleed or die.

                            A few years ago, the designer was impressed by a Halloween fair in Tivoli, Denmark, where he saw a lot of children dressed as wizards. When she was creating toys, these little wizards immediately appeared before her. Then, Paii borned. Paii’s personality comes from people with social phobia, the designer said that people with social phobia is usually shy and does not have the self-confidence, so they act a little strange sometimes. But imperfection is sometimes a kind of perfection, which because that when they are loved by others, they will try their best to warm those people.

                            <b>Story: </b> Skullpanda’s designers see Skullpanda as her alter ego. Skullpanda is set up as a individual girl who can travel freely in the universe and experience various kinds of life in different time and space. Every Skullpanda’s story and painting is a desiner's reflection of her own life. For example, angels may not always be good and pure, and demons may not only have a dark side.

            <y style="font-size:x-large;">I</y> am a bit of an introvert. <br>  
            Moreover, due to my strong ability of empathy, my emotions are easily affected by the emotions of others. <br> 
            <br>
            Therefore, socializing is an energy consuming thing for me. Although I may appear to outsiders as a lively person, only I know that after a social activity, I always need a quiet time alone to recharge.<br> 
            <br>
            At the same time, I am also a person who loves fantasy. <br> I often have strange ideas in my mind, and this makes my life a lot of fun.

            <h1>My Passion</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>
            <y style="font-size:x-large;">B</y>ecause of the above characteristics, I'm more comfortable with nature, animals and artworks than with people. <br> 
            They always immerse me in and make me have a better sense of who I am. <br><br>
            Among them, my favorite is artworks, especially Art Toys. They are like my childhood toys, which can bring me the purest joy and infinite imagination.<br> 
            When I look at them, it's as if I'm writing a story about them, and it's as if I'm communicating with their designers in deep. <br> 
            What's interesting is that everyone has different interpretations of one art toy, which is closely related to everyone's experience and personality. <br> Whenever I think of this, I can't help but marvel at the wonder of human beings.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, on my website, I want to share with you these wonderful artworks, that is, these kidult's toys. <br> 
            In this increasingly impetuous world, hope they can bring you some inner peace.
